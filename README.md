# Su-So
**Sudoku Solver**.

## Project in a nutshell 
While I got my hands dirty on the **Digit classification dataset problem** ,I wondered where could I possibly use it . One idea which hit my head was to solve a sudoku. I could just take a snap of the sudoku from the newspaper and the computer could solve it for me , I learnt that **backtracking** would work well to solve the sudoku but I had to inupt the numbers, which was not at all cool. I also found out that I could build a **Computer Vision** solution to it , which could possibly predict the digits and empty spaces. That's what it all took to start **#Su-So**. Besides that there has been many implementations with this project such as real time projections on the paper. It too didn't hit me interesting. At the end if I could predict the sudoku , I should be able to play with  it as well,
So I built a **GUI** model for it. All it has to do is create a interface for me to solve the sudoku , and when I quit(which is usually the case :) , I would ask the computer to solve it.
